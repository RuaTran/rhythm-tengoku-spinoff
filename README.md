# みんなのリズム天国 Spinoff
This is a small personal project made for a friend that is a game in the style of みんなのリズム天国 over two days, It currently features one rhythm minigame, and gameplay consists of timed button pushes to music. With the exception of the hiragana and katakana sprites and the music, all sprites and animations were done by me.

 It would be fun to turn this project into a full-fledged customizable editor, but to do so would require a lot effort and there are a lot of similar projects currently in the same vein. Despite it not being perfect, I'm sharing this so that others can potentially learn from the project's code.

## Usage
Simply click on **Releases** on the right side of the site to download v1.0.0, which contains a zip file with the game executable. Additionally, if you'd like to compile it yourself, the GMS2 **source code** is available for you to inspect and modify freely. In order to build it, download the source and open the project in Game Maker Studio, and click 'Build' in the top left window.
## Controls
- Spacebar - Progress the menu or hit a note in the minigame
- F1 - Show debug information regarding the game, or restart the animation on the main menu
- F2 - Toggle Cheats for the game so that every note is hit perfectly
## To-do
- Change the note judgement system to allow for intentional missing
- Add post-game screen
- Create menu for potential other minigames
- Implement state machines in a consistent manner (main menu and gameplay use different standards)
- Improve documentation for readability
## Contact
I'm open to any questions that people may have about this project, so please feel free to send a message to MunfMunf#9104 if you're looking at the code in an attempt to modify it or use bits of it to make your own project.

## Disclaimer
Rhythm Heaven is owned by Nintendo and this is a fan project inspired by it. If it is necessary then I can take this project down.
